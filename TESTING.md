## Code Validation

I have been using linter and flake8 to test for code errors. Using the command python -m flake8 I was given a list of changes that needed to be made. I changed most of what was suggested however there are a new lines that remain over 79 characters because it broke the code when I added it to another line. I will continue working on removing as many of them as I can but a few may remain after project submission.

Once I had completed the store I used the [Black code formatter](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to ensure the code is formatted correctly.




## Bugs

- When saving a product to the wishlist you can not select a size. If you select XL size an error occurs. Doesnâ€™t always happen on heroku, but size isn't an option for the wishlist, just the product. The ability to add size and an add to cart button have been included in future implementation.

- Phone number area on checkout form let me put in letters. It should be numbers only and an attempt was made to change that but this broke the checkout process. Further investigation into making it work is needed.

# name and email didnt appear on the profile after an order was placed - detail how you sorted that one out
