## Features Testing

A thorough manual testing process was undertaken to ensure all parts of the store worked as it should. Both the admin area and the main store were tested.

<details>

### Admin Features:

Manual tests were conducted in the admin area to ensure everything is working. There was an error when deleting orders and the necessary refactoring of code took place to remove that error. 

Admin Area - Role based access control successful - users are unable to log into the admin area

In the admin area products/categories/reviews can be added, edited and deleted. The following manual tests took place to ensure they all worked.

Reviews area:

**Emails via gmail:**
Emails are received (to the gmail account being used to send emails to customers) when a new order is placed. If an email is incorrect admin is also told about that too. These emails are just test@test.com emails used when testing checkout.

### Store Features

Tests have been undertaken to ensure the registration, email confirmation, confirming email, log-in, log out and password request all work.
Also tested has been the shopping journey from adding to wishlist, adding and removing products to shopping cart and checking out as an anonymous buyer as well as a registered buyer.
The process of adding a review has been tested for buyers and also for unregistered users.
This has all been documented on the [READ ME HERE](https://github.com/todiane/poster-palace)

Other manual tests have taken place. 

I went through the customer journey procedure myself and three other people tested the site and the checkout process as well as adding a review and using the wishlist. Below are the results

## UI testing

Bootstrap is a responsive language so the mobile-first design approach has been taken care of for the most part, however, tests were performed to ensure the following:

| Test | Result | 
|:---|:---: |
| Toggle navbar doesn’t convert to navbar until over 990px |  PASS  |
| Search bar placeholder is always fully visible  |  PASS  |
| Size of social button icons respond as space increases |  PASS  |
| Product list scales from two columns to four at medium breakpoint  |  PASS  |
| Footer scales according to screen size |  PASS  |
| Search features remain visible on all screen sizes  |  PASS  |


## Browser Compatibility

Layout: The layout and appearance of the site has been tested for consistency throughout browsers. Browers tested include the main four:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

All links were tested and working. All pages load as expected and all features work as expected.

## Responsiveness

The eCommerce store looks and functions as intended on different browsers.

## Code Validation

I have been using linter and flake8 to test for code errors. Flake8 is installed and being used to ensure PEP8 python standard.

<details>

Using the command python -m flake8 I was given a list of changes that needed to be made. I changed most of what was suggested however there are a few lines that remain over 79 characters because it broke the code when I added it to another line. I will continue working on removing as many of them as I can but a few may remain after project submission.

<img src="readme/testing/rm-flake8-messages.png" width="50%"><br><br>

I also used the Code Instiute [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to test the py files. Again, where lines of code were long and I didn't want to risk breaking the site by changing them e.g. see settings image below, I left the code intact.

Settings.py

<img src="readme/testing/rm-python-settings.png" width="70%"><br><br>

Views.py - in main project

<img src="readme/testing/rm-python-project-views.png" width="70%"><br><br>

Url pages - all url pages were tested within ALL APPS and are without errors 

<img src="readme/testing/rm-python-url.png" width="70%"><br><br>

The following were tested within each app 

- Admin
- Forms
- Models
- Views - and all were without error. Code lines over the 79 characters were adjusted were possible and left if it caused additional errors to arise.

Also tested were any 

- context.py
- signal.py 

Even though using PEP8 and the CI Linter may seem like doubling up on work the linter did catch a few additional issues that using -m flak8 didn't, plus the CI linter is easier to work with rather than a long list of issues that need to be looked through.

<img src="readme/testing/rm-python-apps.png" width="70%"><br><br>


Once I had completed the store I used the [Black code formatter](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to ensure the code is formatted correctly.

## CSS Validation

I used the CSS Validation service to test the site. I have been testing using the Heroku site and one error was found (added 2o0px instead of 200px) in the file and I corrected this and tested again in local.

<img src="readme/testing/rm-css-validation.png" width="90%"><br><br>

</details>

## JavaScript Validation

All javascript was put through the [JSHINT tool](https://jshint.com/)

countryfield.js

The newsletter and event pages contains errors because of the code provided by MailChimp for the newsletter, which I didn't want to tamper with so those errors remain.

The products page highlighted errors due to the sort selector, but nothing to do with the html code itself.

</details>


<p align="right">(<a href="#contents">back to top</a>)</p>

## Lighthouse Validation

The original lighthouse score for the index page was 80% so I had to add aria tags to my footer, add "defer" to some of the scripts in base.html, reduce the size of the images on the homepage plus save them as webp rather than png. The score increased to 90%. The remaining issue is the box at the top of the page with web content in it, which Lighthouse refers to as the "largest contentful paint". 

<details>

The scripts being in the header also caused lower scores and I added defer in some, defer in the Stripes linked caused it to stop working so I removed it.

***All pages scored 90% or above for accessibility.***

#### Index Page: 
Accessibility was given a score of 90% first time around because of a missing ```<ul>``` element in the mobile header. Once that was added the score increased to 100% but the navbar stopped working on larger screens so I removed it.

<img src="readme/testing/rm-lighthouse-accessibility.png" width="70%"><br>

<img src="readme/testing/rm-lighthouse.png" width="70%"><br><br>

SEO was given a 100% score overall

## Behaviour Driven Testing

Behaviour driven tests have been carried out based on user stories and using the Gerkin format. The behaviour of each story was tested to ensure the 'Scenario', 'Given', 'When' 'Then' and 'And' aspects of testing work correctly. For example:

<details>

**Behaviour Driven Test**

**SCENARIO:** "As a buyer I receive email confirmation after purchase"

Given: That a user has purchased a product

And: Their email has been received and is correct

When: The sale goes through

Then: The system will automatically generate an email

And: It will be sent to the buyer as confirmation of their purchase

The behaviour driven tests have been included inside each user story on the [GitHub Project Page](https://github.com/users/todiane/projects/10/views/1)


</details>

## Automated Testing

I had originally set up a number of tests (as you can see from my commits) but wasn't sure if they were correct so deleted them.
Tests have been written, and added to the tests folder, for models, views, and urls. 

<details>

I have set up the database in the settings file so that I can change from the production database to the development database (DEVELOPMENT_DB) during testing. The development database is free of products/users and so can be used to test as if the project is just beginning.


The Django built-in unit testing framework was used to test the applications functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command:

```
python3 manage.py test
```

To create the coverage report, I  first installed coverage

```
pip install coverage

```

Then I was able to run any of the following commands:

```

coverage run manage.py test

coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test

coverage report

```

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following command:

```

coverage html - generates the htmlcov/index.html file to view the report

python -m http.server

```

The following files were added to gitignore

```
.coverage
htmlcov/

```

TestCase was used to test models and views. As there is no database needed for tessting urls SimpleTestCase was used.

Below are the results from my coverage report:

## Bugs

<details>

- When saving a product to the wishlist you can not select a size. If you select XL size an error occurs. Doesn’t always happen on heroku, but size isn't an option for the wishlist, just the product. 

- Another size issue is making a size a required field. I have tried to change the size model (as per my commits) in different ways so that a size must be selected but I wasn't able to get it to work, despite help from tutor support. I didn't want to change the model too many times in case the database ended up corrupted, so it is possible to add a product without selecting a size and the order will still go through. I could have added javascript to validate the size and bring up an error if a size wasn't selected but that only really changes the client side validation and I want to be able to add server side validation. This is something I am focused on learning how to achieve so I can update the site at some point.

- When writing a review the star rating is required as a minimum. A buyer cannot add a review without it. If they complete the title and review box but do not select a star rating nothing happens. I have tried to include an error message to let them know if the star rating is not selected but despite using different code (and help from tutor support) the error message does not display.

- Phone number area on checkout form let me put in letters. It should be numbers only and an attempt was made to change that but this broke the checkout process. Further investigation into making it work is needed.

- Creating a sticky footer. Despite trying I have been unable to create a sticky footer and discovering how to include this in Django is something I need to learn.

- There is an error message in the browser after checkout

```Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.```

However, I placed an order and it went through to Stripe

<img src="readme/testing/rm-stripe-payment.png" width="90%"><br><br>

<img src="readme/testing/rm-stripe-payment1.png" width="90%"><br><br>


- when you write a review selecting a star rating is required however no error message appears if you do not select stars. I have attempted to add it using the following as shown at [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error_messages-django-form-field-validation/)

```
class Meta:
        model = Reviews
        fields = ['subject', 'rating', 'review']
        error_messages = {
            'rating': {
                'required': "Please select a rating."  # Custom error message for the required field
            }
        }
```
and to override the __init__ method of the form and set the required attribute for the "rating" field to True. Neither worked. The review won't submit without the rating but no indication as to why shows up for the user, which is not UI friendly.

```
class ReviewForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(ReviewForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['rating'].required = True
        self.fields['rating'].error_messages = {'required': 'Please select a rating'}

    class Meta:
        model = Reviews
        fields = ["subject", "review", "rating"]

```

## Retrospective

Manual testing is a straight forward process that I have performed many times and find easy to complete. After completing the project I decided to learn more about automated testing. 

<details>

I still struggle to understand the concept a little and went over the CI training material again. Going back to the Javascript training and watching the Testing Paradigms video reminded me about behaviour driven testing, which I added to my project. In the same video it mentioned that testing can be carried out after the creation of code which is why I decided to add automated testing to my project. 

Separating the database and using the development database that had none of the current content/information made it similar to starting from zero and adding testing.

The training suggested that tests can be carried out in a folder or under each individual app. I opted to put the tests in a folder but adding all the views became a little confusing so in the future I will add tests within their own app.

I still have some work to do to really appreciate the value of test driven data and will continue learning about this area of coding. 

With so many different testing options available to save confusion I need to decide on a testing framework and focus on learning that until I understand how it works.
