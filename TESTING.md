## Features Testing

I have

**Registration**

**Log in and log out**

#1. **Product Listing**: Test if products are listed correctly.
#2. **Product Detail**: Test if individual product details are correct when selected.
#3. **Add to Cart**: Test if items can be added to the shopping cart.
#4. **Cart Operations**: Test operations like updating quantity, removing items, etc.
#5. **Checkout Process**: Test the checkout process including customer information collection, payment processing, and order confirmation.
#6. **Order Posting**: Test if the order details are correctly posted to the database and if the order processing (e.g., preparing for delivery) starts as expected.

## Browser Compatibility

Layout: The layout and appearance of the site has been tested for consistency throughout browsers. Browers tested include the main four:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

All links were tested and working. All pages load as expected and all features work as expected.

## Responsiveness

The eCommerce store looks and functions as intended on different browsers.

## Code Validation

I have been using linter and flake8 to test for code errors. Flake8 is installed and being used to ensure PEP8 python standard

Using the command python -m flake8 I was given a list of changes that needed to be made. I changed most of what was suggested however there are a new lines that remain over 79 characters because it broke the code when I added it to another line. I will continue working on removing as many of them as I can but a few may remain after project submission.

Once I had completed the store I used the [Black code formatter](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to ensure the code is formatted correctly.




## Bugs

- When saving a product to the wishlist you can not select a size. If you select XL size an error occurs. Doesnâ€™t always happen on heroku, but size isn't an option for the wishlist, just the product. The ability to add size and an add to cart button have been included in future implementation.

- Phone number area on checkout form let me put in letters. It should be numbers only and an attempt was made to change that but this broke the checkout process. Further investigation into making it work is needed.

- when you write a review selecting a star rating is required however no error message appears if you do not select stars. I have attempted to add it using the following as shown at [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error_messages-django-form-field-validation/)

```
class Meta:
        model = Reviews
        fields = ['subject', 'rating', 'review']
        error_messages = {
            'rating': {
                'required': "Please select a rating."  # Custom error message for the required field
            }
        }
```
and to override the __init__ method of the form and set the required attribute for the "rating" field to True. Neither worked. The review won't submit without the rating but no indication as to why shows up for the user, which is not UI friendly.

```
class ReviewForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(ReviewForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['rating'].required = True
        self.fields['rating'].error_messages = {'required': 'Please select a rating'}

    class Meta:
        model = Reviews
        fields = ["subject", "review", "rating"]

```

Automated Testing

However, you can also separate your database for testing and production benefits and update the settings.py file depending on whether you are testing or the project is complete and deployed so should be in production.

````
DEVELOPMENT_DB = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}

PRODUCTION_DB = {"default": dj_database_url.parse(os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"))}

DATABASES = PRODUCTION_DB
