  <p>We offer Free Standard Shipping on All Orders over Â£40.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, our worldwide shipping fee is 10% of your total order.</p>
  <p>After you place an order, we will follow up with order information sent to the email address provided when you

    your order. For more information, please refer to our <a href="{% url 'terms' %}">Terms Of Service</a></p>
  <p><strong>DO YOU DELIVER INTERNATIONALLY?</strong></p>

  <p>Please note, we may be subject to various rules and restrictions in relation to some international deliveries and
    you may be subject to additional taxes and duties over which we have no control. If such cases apply, you are
    responsible for complying with the laws applicable to the country where you live and will be responsible for any
    such additional costs or taxes.</p>
