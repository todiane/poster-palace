                <p>Diverse design is an event run by Poster Palace, usually seasonal (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) but also to celebrate specific events.
                    It's an event started by our newsletter subscribers and is resevered solely for them, so you
                    only find out about details of any upcoming events if you have subscribed to our newsletter. The
                    idea is that either as an individual or a small group (3-5 people) you can design and submit
                    ideas for new posters. There is a cash prize to be won as well as the kudos of your design being
                    made available to buy on our website and some social media promotion.

                    <p>To take part, and to receive regular updates, join our newsletter:
